STEP 1: ACTIVATE

kubectl port-forward elasticsearch-statefullset-0 9200:9200 (elasticsearch-statefullset-0 is the pod name gotten by kubectl get pods)

To activate trial version:
POST http://localhost:9200/_xpack/license/start_trial?acknowledge=true
(Basic Auth)


To verify whether the license is activated:
GET http://localhost:9200/_xpack/license

curl --user elastic:P@ssword123 -X GET "http://localhost:9200/?pretty"

Once trial license is activated you can close the terminal as port forwarding isnâ€™t needed anymore.


X-Pack security provides built-in user credentials to help you get up and running. These users have a fixed set of privileges and cannot be authenticated until their passwords have been set. The elastic user can be used to set all of the built-in user passwords.
